From this have evolved the desire to share experiences on building and managing databases in REDCap with R.\nThe goal is to write a handbook for new researchers working with REDCap and R and to have a reference for more experienced users. The book will be heavy on examples and suggestions to best practice.\nA comprehensive overview of tools for working with REDCap databases can be found here: REDCap-tools repository."

    "text": "A niche?\nIn my work with REDCap, in building databases and working with data, I have been very happy working in R. This helps to ensure reproducible work and gives better overview, when working with larger databases, or when using a dataset or variable description as the foundation for the database. The last is most often the case.\nThere are many guidelines for working with the graphical interface, but I’ve not been able to find much guidance for working through the REDCap API in R. This book tries to fill that niche."

    "text": "2 Data access\nThis section is intended as a “REDCap data manipulation 101” for pre-graduate students in the group and as an intro to getting RStudio set up for working with REDCap data in general.\nWorking with data in general, a rule of thumb is to store as little sensitive data as possible directly on your computer. The old way, would be to get a spreadsheet and have that on your computer. We don’t consider that safe or good practice any more. A better way is to store data on a secure server and only access the necessary data in the required timespan and then have the data deleted again. Any accumulated analysis results as figures and tables can of course be saved locally if they are correctly created.\nWe use REDCap to store research data. There are a few R-packages, that lets us work with data from REDCap directly in R, to achieve the above goal of secure data handling. In this book, the interface between R and REDCap is based on the REDCapR-package(Beasley 2022), but with extended functionality to handle the castlelated data of REDCap datasets when using longitudanl functionality and repeating events, through the REDCapCAST-package.(Damsbo and Egeler 2023)\nThe REDCapR-package contains a lot of great functions, that is use-full in advanced use cases. In the following things have been simplified a little for the new user.\nA more thorough discussion on REDCap data can be found later as well as a chapter on tips to building a REDCap database."

    "text": "2.1 Getting access\nBefore you are able to get any data out of REDCap, make sure that you are able to get in to REDCap, meaning you’ve had a user created by the project administrator (your supervisor will know). To access the REDCap web interface, a username, password an done-time-token is used. To access through R, a so-called API-key is used, which is an alpha-numeric key used to verify yourself to the REDCap server, when requesting data export.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe API key equals user name and password, and circumvents the two-factor verification process. Naturally, the API key should be kept in a safe way.\nTo be clear: NEVER STORE THE API-KEY AS PLAIN TEXT.\n\n\nInstead of storing the API-key in your R-script or in a text-file on your computer, the keyring-package can be used to store your API key in your operating systems secure keychain.(R-keyring?)\nBelow will follow an easy-to-use implementation with secure API key storage and data retrieval.\nThe library(keyring)(R-keyring?) offers a safe and easy way to store API keys and other secrets. Please copy and run the code below:\n\nrequire(keyring)\nkey_set(\"API_KEY\", prompt = \"API key: \")\n\n\nkey_set(\"DB_URI\", prompt = \"Data base uri: \")\n\nDo note, that the name “API_KEY” can be changed to whatever you prefer. Note that the function will overwrite any existing keys with the same name without any warning (!)."

The package library(REDCapTidieR)(R-REDCapTidieR?) provides a solution to the castellation, but downloads full instruments, which is not always desirable.\nIn the following, the two approaches will be demonstrated including a possible third approach, requiring a little more technical willingness.\n\n2.0.1 Focus\nThere are different packages to access and download data from R. In the , available tools and packages are referenced. Here I will provide an example, as to download minimal data in a focused way, using REDCapR.(Beasley 2022).\nPlease have a look in the REDCap-chapter for an optimised approach when handling events and repeated instruments.\n\nlibrary(REDCapR)\n# Returns the variables \"record_id\" and \"age\".\nds_some_vars &lt;- redcap_read(\n  redcap_uri   = keyring::key_get(\"DB_URI\"),  # This is the address for projects at the AU-server\n  token        = keyring::key_get(\"API_KEY\"),\n  fields       = c(\"record_id\", \"age\")\n)$data \n\n# Return only records with IDs of 1 and 4\nds_some_rows &lt;- redcap_read(\n  redcap_uri   = keyring::key_get(\"DB_URI\"),  # This is the address for projects at the AU-server\n  token        = keyring::key_get(\"API_KEY\"),\n  records      = c(1, 4)\n)$data\n\nTo get a full list of available variable names, you can either go through the codebook on REDCap, or you can try the following, but be aware, that the resulting vector of variable names can get a little long and confusing.\n\n# Returns a vector of names of all accessible variables.\nvariable_names &lt;- redcap_read(\n  redcap_uri   = keyring::key_get(\"DB_URI\"),  # This is the address for projects at the AU-server\n  token        = keyring::key_get(\"API_KEY\")\n)$data |&gt; \n  colnames()\n\nHere is an example on how to export data on RBANS and cleaning the data for plotting.\n\nds &lt;- redcap_read(\n  redcap_uri   = keyring::key_get(\"DB_URI\"),  # This is the address for projects at the AU-server\n  token        = keyring::key_get(\"API_KEY\"),\n  records      = c(1:35), # Downloading data from ID 1 to 35.\n  forms        = \"rbans\", # Downloading only the RBANS instrument\n  event        = c(\"3_months_arm_1\", # Specifying only to download 3 and 12 months data\n                   \"12_months_arm_1\")\n  )$data |&gt; \n  select( # Selecting variables to keep\n    c(\"record_id\",\n      \"redcap_event_name\",\n      ends_with(c(\"_is\",\"_lo\",\"_up\",\"_per\"))) # I only want index scores, lower and upper CIs and percentile.\n         )   |&gt; \n  na.omit() # Omitting IDs with missing data.\nhead(ds, n = 5) # Showing only the first 5 rows\n\nFurther examples and scripts can be found in the ENIGMA code repository.\n\n\n2.0.2 All at once\n\n\n2.0.3 The middle ground\n\n\n\n\nBeasley, Will. 2022.
