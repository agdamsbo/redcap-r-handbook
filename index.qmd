# Preface {#sec-preface .unnumbered}

This is a handbook on working with REDCap in R.

The book is written out of necessity as documentation for new undergraduate students to work in R with study data stored in a REDCap data base. From this have evolved the desire to share experiences on building and managing databases in REDCap with R.

The goal is to write a handbook for new researchers working with REDCap and R and to have a reference for more experienced users. The book will be heavy on examples and suggestions to best practice.
